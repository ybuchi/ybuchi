Hi! I'm Yannik
===============

A mission-driven software engineer
---------------------------------------------
Originally from the mountainous country of Switzerland, I am currently based in Queens, New York and am on a mission to make a positive impact on society and the environment one block of code at the time. My main focus is on creating full-stack web applications using the power of JavaScript and React to create seamless user interfaces and Ruby-on-Rails (and sometimes server-side JavaScript) to construct effective data models and APIs following using an MVC architecture.

### Projects I'm currently working on?

**[Cuisto](https://cuisto.herokuapp.com/):**
The app for home cooks. If you're like me and you're convinced that the best meals are the ones cooked at home, then this application is for you. Cuisto allows you to track your pantry and fridge ingredients from which it can automatically recommend recipes in your library and create shopping lists, saving you tons of time rummaging through your fridge trying to figure out what your next meal is.

### Open to Work
I'm currently looking for software engineering opportunities in/around New York City or remote! What I am looking for in my next role:

- **A Challenge:** First and foremost, as a self-driven individual looking for their first professional role in software engineering, I am looking for a role in a highly collaborative team with a hands-on approach to learning, mentoring, and exploring new tools and technologies.
- **A High Growth Potential:** I've shown throughout my career that I've been able to quickly learn new languages and technologies on the fly. As such, I am looking for an entry-level role that offers both the support and opportunity to quickly grow into a senior position.
- **Front-End Technologies:** As I've grown as an engineer, I've developed a particular focus on the frontend using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as the latter's related technologies and frameworks. I have a high desire to develop professional experience in libraries and frameworks including but not limited to React, Next.js, Redux, and TypeScript. My next position would ideally focus on the front-end, but I am also keen on expanding my experience to the back-end as well. 
- **Mission-Driven Work:** I'm looking to leverage and grow my skills at a company on a mission to make a positive impact on the world. Mostly, this reflects my desire to work at a company with a people-first approach to handling their business and their employees.
