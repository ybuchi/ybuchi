Hi! I'm Yannik, a mission-driven full-stack software engineer originally from Le Vaud, Switzerland and currently based in Queens, NY. I'm passionate about building applications that help people do the things that matter to them better. 

Projects I'm currently working on?

Cuisto: THE app for home cooks. If you're like me and you love to cook at home, this is the place to  browse, write and store your favorite recipes. What's more? Create your own smart fridges, auto-generate your grocery shopping list, and get recommended recipes based on what ingredients you have. Check it out here: https://cuisto.herokuapp.com/ .

Ellis: Looking to become a U.S. citizen? Or are you American but want to see if you would pass a naturalization interview? Use Ellis, the app I created to study and quiz yourself to ace it, for fun or for real. Check it out here: https://gorgeous-empanada-210319.netlify.app/ . 

As a full-stack engineer, my main programming languages  and frameworks are JavaScript and React in the front-end and Ruby-on-Rails in the backend. As a former data analyst, I also bring an advanced knowledge and implementation  of SQL dialects, relational databases and data visualizations, as well as experience with Agile methodologies and workflow tools like JIRA. 

I’m currently looking for for opportunities as a front-end, back-end, or full-stack engineer to keep growing and working on exciting and innovative products. If you're looking for a fast-learning, analytical and people-centered engineer, please feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or by emailing me at yannik.buchi95@gmail.com.
