Hi! 

I'm Yannik, a passionate, mission-driven software engineer originally from Le Vaud, Switzerland but currently based in Queens. To me, the best thing about programming is that it is both an art and a science. As someone who grew up playing a lot of piano and studying biology and literature, I've always had one foot in the sciences and one foot in the humanities. I set out on my professional career with a strong desire to acquire the skills and experience necessary to leverage technology to make the world a happier place. I've since grown my skills from self-taught knowledge of SQL, Python, and data analysis to a robust knowledge and experience of front-end and backend-technologies including JavaScript, React and Ruby-on-Rails.

I am currently looking for job opportunities in software engineering (fullstack, frontend, or backend), so if you're looking for a software engineer (remote or New York City area), please feel free to reach out to me at yannik.buchi95@gmail.com!

A summary of my current experience:

- building fullstack web applications using React and Node.js (3+ years), Ruby-on-Rails (1 year) and Express (1 year)
- advanced knowlege of SQL and working with relational databases and data warehouses (3+ years)
- leveraging Python for data extraction, manipulation and analysis using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy and more. (1 year)
- 3+ years of experience working in a fast-paced agile team, using product management software like JIRA to prioritize tasks and making optimal product decisions
- 3+ years of experience working with software and data engineers in the back-end using tools and technologies like Databricks, Redshift, Apache Hive

In addition, I bring: 

- a ton of energy, curiosity, and desire to grow as a software engineer
- written and spoken fluency in French and English (conversational in German)
