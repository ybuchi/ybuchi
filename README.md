Hi! I'm Yannik and I am a software engineer originally from Le Vaud, Switzerland based in Queens, New York. I believe the best thing about programming is that it is both an art and a science. I grew up playing piano and studying biology and literature, and so I always had one foot in the sciences and one foot in the humanities. When I discovered coding, I realized that being a software engineer allowed me to express both my creative and logical sides to design and build incredibly powerful applications.

Since then, I have gained experience working building applications in JavaScript, HTML, CSS using the MERN stack and have extensive work experience leveraging SQL, Python, and relational databases for data manipulation and analysis. 

Feel free to contact me at yannik.buchi95@gmail.com, even if you just want to chat!
